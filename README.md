Object Tracking and Characteristics Analysis using MATLAB

Color can be used as a feature to identify objects in 2D/3D Space. The approach here is to specify the color and its threshold values to identify
the object, in this case a ball. The code is further extended to find approximate speed of the ball and its distance from the camera. This project of color extration, detection and analysis are few of the fundamental techniques in Computer Vision.
